      canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past.Online menus with photographs of the
      meals prepared,and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional
      choices.Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the
      school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have.Odering Online
      by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling,making it safer and less
      complicated for staff and students alike.Here again,diversity is the key.</p>

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-7">Implemented Online Attendance Management System:This
      imforms parents about their child's/children's activities in the school,instantly.Once a student reaches the school,the
      parents will be imformed about the status via text messages.This hepls schools keep a record of the students absenteeism.
      Students can mark the attendance by logging in,and this is stored in a database,which can later be checked by the Admin.
      The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to
      establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculum subjects.As soon as you enter a students Enrollment
      Number or Name,details like avalibility in classes,number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are 
      possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities.
